# Eulers-method-and-Least-Squares-Method
Solving RL circuit with diode using least squares approximation method and Euler's method
Two numerical method is used to solve RL circuit with a diode.Least squares method used for fitting the given diode data.
Euler's method is used to solve initial value problem of RL circuit.
Time-Current graph is plotted also Time-Voltage graph is plotted for diode,resistor and inductor with two different step sizes.
Diode data is given in diodedata.dat file.
R=14.2 ohms  L=0.98H  Vs=2V
